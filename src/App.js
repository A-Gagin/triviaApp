// functionality that I have so far:
// - The app should display a predetermined amount of questions pulled from the Open Trivia API
// - The correct answer should be indistinguishable from incorrect answers
// - Users should be able to select an answer for each question
// - After selecting an answer, there should be some sort of visual feedback to display whether the selected answer was right or wrong
// - The user should not be able to change their answer

// functionality that I need to implement:
// - All required functionality implemented!
// - Perhaps improve how it looks with material-ui?
